Digital Signature Server
An organization implements a Digital Signature Service (DSS), a trusted third party that 
creates public-private key pairs, stores them and generates digital signatures on the 
behalf of the organization's employees. 
Organization’s employees are registered off-line. At registration, an employee receives 
the DSS’ public key and a password that has to be changed at the first login. An employee 
maintains the public key of the server.
After securely connecting to the DSS, a user may invoke the following operations request.


● CreateKeys which creates and stores a pair of private and public keys on behalf 
of the invoking user. If a key pair is already existing for the user, the operation has 
no effect.
● SignDoc which returns the digital signature on the document specified as 
argument. The service digitally signs the document on the invoking user’s behalf 
and returns him/her the resulting digital signature.
● GetPublicKey which returns the public key of the user specified as argument.
● DeleteKeys which deletes the key pair of the invoking user. After a key pair has 
been deleted, an user cannot create a new one unless (s)he is (off-line) registered 
again.


Users interact with the DSS through a secure channel that must be established before 
issuing operations. A user authenticates the service by means of the service’s public key. 
A user authenticates to the service by means of her/his password. The secure channel 
must fulfill perfect forward secrecy (PFS), integrity, no-replay and non-malleability. 
The server stores private keys of users in their encrypted form.
Project report must contain:


● Specifications and design choices with particular reference to the authentication 
protocol between a user and the service.
● Format of all the exchanged messages.
● Sequence Diagrams of every used communication protocol (Application Level).
